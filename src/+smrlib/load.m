% load SMR file
% this is a wrapper-rewrite of an older function
% called SONImport that could load SMR files
% it was pretty hard to use and a number of baroque
% conventions, left open files, and had a number of 
% other issues
% I've slimmed it down, made some simplifying assumptions
% and removed a bunch of evals

% ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%
% SONIMPORT copies all channels into a MAT-file
%
% Note: Use ImportSMR in the sigTOOL package in preference to SONImport
% unless you want data stored in the same way as with previous versions of
% the SON library.
%
% SONIMPORT(FID, {OPTIONS});
% where:
%         FID is the matlab file handle
%         OPTIONS if present, are a set of one or more arguments
%                   (see below)
% When present, OPTIONS must be the last input argument. Valid options
% are:
% 'ticks', 'microseconds', 'milliseconds' and 'seconds' cause times to
%    be scaled to the appropriate unit (seconds by default)in HEADER
% 'scale' - calls smrlib.SONADCToDouble to apply the channel scale and offset to DATA
%    which will  be cast to double precision
% Other options will have no effect
%
% Returns 0 if successful, -1 otherwise
%
% SONIMPORT stores data in a Level 5 Version 6 compatible MAT-file that can
% be read on any MATLAB supported platform.
% SONIMPORT copies the FileHeader returned by smrlib.SONFileHeader to the MAT-file
% then loads each channel in turn. The DATA and HEADER fields that would be
% returned by smrlib.SONGetChannel are then saved. The DATA vector, matrix or
% structure is saved as CHANX where X is the channel number e.g.
% CHAN1 for channel 1. The HEADER is saved as a structure named
% HEADX.
%
% Note that SONIMPORT loads each channel in turn but loads the entire
% channel. Very lengthy channels can cause an out-of-memory error,
% particularly when scaling waveform data to double precision. 
% SONIMPORT issues a warning when this happens and attempts to recover by
% calling
%   smrlib.SONGetChannel(FID, CHAN, 'MAT', 'MATFILENAME' {,OPTIONS})
% The waveform load routines (smrlib.SONGetADCChannel and smrlib.SONGetRealWaveChannel)
% will add the data for the specified channel block-by-block (or
% frame-by-frame) using low-level I/O without having all the data loaded at
% once. If this fails, an incomplete channel entry will be left corrupting
% the MAT-file. SONIMPORT then deletes the MAT-file and returns -1.
% The low-level I/O to the MAT-files has not yet been tested on the
% Mac or other big-endian platforms.
