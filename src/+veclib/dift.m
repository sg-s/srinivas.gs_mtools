% derivative of a non-regularly sampled time series
% 
% dift.m is a function that differentiates the time series x,
% where elements of x are located at corresponding times t
% update to dift.m on last edit @ 01:37 on Wednesday the 31th 
% now supports the differentiation of matrices, 
% treating each row as a different time series.
